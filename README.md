# DNA Highlighting

An addon to provide highlighting for the presence of DNA on an entity for Detectives. There's client-side fade-in to prevent corpses/weapons from being too obvious. This does technically leak the positions of bodies/weapons but those entities are already known to cheaters so I don't feel telling them the entity also has DNA is a risk.

This addon intends to make DNA searching something other than bodies more intuitive. All weapons, C4, radios - and with another addon of mine - blood splatter, all have DNA on them. Sadly, I only see Detectives searching bodies and perhaps defused C4. This aims to ameliorate that.
